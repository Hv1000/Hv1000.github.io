I'm a second-year mathematics Ph.D. student at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Li Wang] (https://liwang-umn.github.io/math/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). Here is my [CV](https://hv1000.github.io/files/Yan_HUANG_CV.pdf).

My current research focuses on <b>kinetic equations</b>, <b>gradient flows</b>, and <b>optimal transport</b>, with an emphasis on developing efficient numerical methods for their solution. Additionally, I am interested in their applications in deep learning and sampling.
