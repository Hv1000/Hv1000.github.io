I'm a first year mathematics Ph.D student at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. Li Wang. I obtained my Bachelor degree in mathematics at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My general research interests lie in computational and applied mathematics. Here is my [CV](https://hv1000.github.io/files/Yan_HUANG_CV.pdf).
