I'm a senior undergraduate majoring in applied mathematics at the [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), China (expect to graduate in June, 2023). I'm also a member of Undergraduate Mathematics Honor Program at SUSTech. After graduation, I will pursue my Ph.D. in mathematics at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). My general research interests lie in computational and applied mathematics. Here is my [CV](https://hv1000.github.io/files/Yan_HUANG_CV.pdf).
