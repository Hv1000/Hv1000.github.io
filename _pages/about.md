I'm a second year mathematics Ph.D. student at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/).

My general research interests lie in applied mathematics, computational mathematics, and data science. I am currently advised by [Prof. Li Wang](https://liwang-umn.github.io/math/). Here is my [CV](https://hv1000.github.io/files/Yan_HUANG_CV.pdf).
