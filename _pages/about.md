I'm a second year mathematics Ph.D. student at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) advised by [Prof. Li Wang](https://liwang-umn.github.io/math/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). Here is my [CV](https://hv1000.github.io/files/Yan_HUANG_CV.pdf).

My general research interests lie in Numerical Solutions for Kinetic Equations, Gradient Flows, Optimal Transport, Mean-field Limits and Scientifc Machine Learning. 

My current research focus on the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau equation in kinetic plasma physics.

$$
\partial_t f + v \cdot \nabla_x f + (E + v \times B) \cdot \nabla_v f = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \nabla_v \cdot \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_v}} |v-v_* |^{2+\gamma} \Pi(v-v_* ) [f(v_* )\nabla_v f(v) -  f(v) \nabla_{v_* } f(v_* ) ] \mathrm{d}v_* \right)
$$
