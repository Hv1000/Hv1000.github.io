I'm a second year mathematics Ph.D. student at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) advised by [Prof. Li Wang](https://liwang-umn.github.io/math/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). Here is my [CV](https://hv1000.github.io/files/Yan_HUANG_CV.pdf).

My general research interests include Numerical Solutions for Kinetic Equations, Gradient Flows, Optimal Transport, Mean-field Limits, and scientific machine learning.
