## Neural Differential Equations, 2022 Spring

- Studied Patrick Kidger's thesis *On Neural Differential Equations* [](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20neural%20differential%20equations%20%28NDEs%29%20demonstrate%20that,as%20residual%20networks%20and%20recurrent%20networks%2C%20are%20discretisations.)
- Learned to understand neural networks from ODE, CDE, and SDE.  
- Presented and led the discussion on numerical solvers of neural differential equations at the seminar.

## Machine Learning in Solving and Learning Differential Equations, 2022 Winter
- Studied *PINN, DeepRitz, DeepONet, FNO, and SINDy*.

## Statistical Learning, 2021 Summer
- Studied *The Element of Statistical Learning* and *Understanding Machine Learning*
