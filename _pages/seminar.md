## Topics in Applied Mathematics, 2022 Fall 

## Neural Differential Equations, 2022 Spring

- Studied Patrick Kidger's thesis *[On Neural Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435)* and other relevant publications. Learned to understand neural networks from ODE and SDE.  
- Presented and led the discussion on numerical solvers of neural differential equations at the seminar, [notes](https://github.com/Hv1000/Hv1000.github.io/blob/master/files/Numerical_Solvers_of_Neural_Differential_Equations.pdf).

## Machine Learning for Solving and Learning Differential Equations, 2022 Winter
- Studied *[PINN](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125)*, *[DeepRitz](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40304-018-0127-z)*, *[DeepONet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03193v3)*, *[FNO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895v1)*, and *[SINDy](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517384113)*.
