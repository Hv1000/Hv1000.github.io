My research focuses on computing the fundamental equation in kinetic plasma physics---the Vlasov-Landau equation:

$$ \partial_t f + v \cdot \nabla_x f + (E + v \times B) \cdot \nabla_v f = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} Q(f, f) , $$

where $f=f(t,x,v)$ is the mass distribution function of charged particles in the phase space, such as electrons or ions. $E$ and $B$ represent the electric and magnetic fields, which can be prescribed or obtained self-consistently through the Maxwell's equation. The parameter $\varepsilon$ is the Knudsen number describing the collision strength. When $\varepsilon \to 0$, one obtains the hydrodynamic limit Euler-Maxwell equation. The collision operator $Q(f,f)$ is known as the Landau / Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator, and is defined by:

$$ Q(f,f) = \nabla_v \cdot \left\{ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_v}} |v-v_* |^{2+\gamma} \Pi(v-v_* ) [f(v_* )\nabla_v f(v) - f(v) \nabla_{v_* } f(v_* ) ] \mathrm{d}v_* \right\} , $$

where 
$$\Pi(z)= I_{d_v} - \frac{z \otimes z}{ |z|^2 } $$
denotes the projection into the orthogonal complement of $$\left\{ z \right\}$$. The parameter $\gamma$ determines the type of interaction between particles. In the case of inverse power law, i.e., when two particles at distance $r$ interact with a force propotional to $$\frac{1}{r^s}$$, $\gamma=\frac{s-5}{s-1}$. The most physically relevant case is $\gamma=-3$, which corresponds to the Coulomb interaction ($s=2$). 

Solving the Vlasov-Landau equation presents significant challenges, primarily due to its high dimensionality, mutilple scales, strong nonlinearity and non-locality. On the other hand, deep learning has progressively transformed the numerical computation of partial differential equations by leveraging neural networks' ability to approximate complex functions and the powerful optimization toolbox.



In my first paper \cite{huang2024scorebasedparticlemethodhomogeneous}, we introduce a score-based particle method for the homogeneous Landau equation, combining structure-preserving particle methods with the score-matching technique, which is popular in generative artificial intelligence. Our method is not only structure-preserving and accurate but also significantly faster than the deterministic particle method, making it promising for solving the Vlasov-Landau equation where a large number of particles are commonly needed. 

In real plasma simulations, the stability of numerical algorithms is crucial. To achieve this, in my second paper \cite{huang2024jkolandauvariationalparticle}, we introduce a variational particle method by leveraging the non-trivial gradient flow structure of the homogeneous Landau equation. The gradient flow structure enables us to develop a solution using the seminal Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, which guarantees desirable exact entropy dissipation and unconditional stability that are lacking in both deterministic and score-based particle methods. In addition, we also design a tailored stochastic optimization algorithm to further reduce computational cost. Therefore, this approach is suitable for plasma simulations over large-scale time periods.
